# Sandbox lease secret rotation runbook

`sandbox_leases.envd_token` is encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM keyed by
`FASTAGENT_OAUTH_SECRET` (the same master secret that protects MCP OAuth
refresh tokens). This runbook covers rotating that secret.

## Impact

- **Existing `sandbox_leases` rows become unreadable** immediately after the
  secret changes on all replicas: reads fail closed at
  `store.EncryptedSandboxLeaseStore`, the pool treats it as a registry
  lookup error and falls back to a local create (fail-open). No plaintext is
  ever written, and no sandbox is destroyed by the rotation itself.
- **Stale rows are reclaimed by TTL**: the next `AcquireSandboxLease` can
  only replace an expired row (default TTL 15 min), so the old rows are
  replaced within TTL or removed on release.
- **A rebuild re-keys its own row**: when a replica replaces a sandbox whose
  row it still owns, `ReplaceSandboxLease` rewrites `envd_token` under the
  current secret. Such rows become readable again without waiting for TTL;
  the rest still age out as above.
- **Orphaned E2B instances** created before rotation are not destroyed by this
  runbook, but they no longer accumulate forever: each one keeps running until
  its provider timeout, pauses there (unbilled), and is then collected by the
  orphan reaper once no lease row still claims it. That requires the deployment
  to have set `FASTAGENT_SANDBOX_POOL_TAG` — without a tag the pool cannot prove
  the instance is its own, so it stays paused indefinitely. See
  [sandbox-pool-leases.md](./sandbox-pool-leases.md) → Stage 5.
- **MCP OAuth is affected too**: the same secret encrypts stored OAuth
  refresh tokens. Rotating it invalidates every stored refresh token and
  forces all users/agents to re-authorize. Coordinate the window and notify
  owners before rotating.

## Steps

1. Generate a new secret:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. Update the secret on every replica (helm value `oauth.secret` →
   `FASTAGENT_OAUTH_SECRET`; stored in the fastagent secret, never in a
   ConfigMap). Roll out so all replicas converge on the same value.
3. Optional fast cleanup (do NOT destroy sandboxes directly): delete the
   stale lease rows so the next request creates fresh leases immediately
   instead of waiting for TTL:

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM sandbox_leases;
   ```

   Deleting the rows is also what unclaims their instances: each one pauses at
   its own provider timeout and is then reaped. The reaper's read needs no key,
   so it works during the rotation window even though the rows themselves are
   unreadable.
4. Verify:

   ```bash
   # gateway log shows shared leases active
   grep 'system sandbox executor pool created' <gateway-log> | grep sharedLeases=true
   # a new session should log 'e2b sandbox created' (fresh lease) and later
   # 'e2b sandbox adopted from shared lease' on sibling pods
   ```

5. Confirm the table holds no plaintext tokens:

   ```sql
   SELECT envd_token FROM sandbox_leases LIMIT 1;
   -- value must be base64 ciphertext, not the raw E2B token
   ```

## Regression coverage

- `TestEncryptedSandboxLeaseStoreRotation` (sqlite): old-key row unreadable,
  new key reclaims after TTL expiry.
- `TestEncryptedSandboxLeaseStoreReplaceSandbox` (sqlite): the rebuild write
  encrypts the replacement token — the raw row holds ciphertext, and the
  decorator decrypts it back.
- `TestEncryptedSandboxLeaseStorePostgres` (Postgres, gated by
  `FASTAGENT_TEST_PG_DSN`): same semantics on the production dialect plus a
  raw-row plaintext check.
